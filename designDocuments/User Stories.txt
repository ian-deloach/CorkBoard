As a user, I would like to be able to manage my solo/team projects with broken down tasks my teammates or I can take.

This means I should be able to...
(MVP)
----------------------------
- Log in to my account
- Edit account information
- View other account information

- Add new projects
- View my current projects
- Edit project information
- Delete projects
- Assign members to projects

- Add new tasks
- Edit task information
- Mark tasks as complete, incomplete, high priority, optional, deleted
- Allow members to assign themselves to tasks

If I have time
----------------------------
- Add more security. Ex: Only project creators can delete tasks/change to optional
- Or must ask for permission first if its a standard user.
