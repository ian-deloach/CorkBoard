It's ok to be uncreative. Just show that you know how to work on things.

Cork Board

Team Project Management

It's basically a task version of git

Create projects
Read available projects so you can mark them as taken
Update user/project/task information
Delete projects/tasks (either by marking as complete or incomplete)


Projects can be broken into tasks
Each project can assign other members so they are able to see them

Maybe make it a fun cork board theme?
