User Stories
-------------
As a user, I would like to be able to manage my solo/team projects with broken down tasks my teammates or I can take.

This means I should be able to...
(MVP)
----------------------------
- Log in to my account
- Edit account information
- View other account information

- Add new projects
- View my current projects
- Edit project information
- Delete projects
- Assign members to projects

- Add new tasks
- Edit task information
- Mark tasks as complete, incomplete, high priority, optional, deleted
